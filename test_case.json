        "expected_output": "As an environmental science expert, addressing increasing air pollution while maintaining industrial productivity requires:\n\n1. Economic Solutions:\n   - Incentives for green practices: Provide tax rebates and subsidies to industries adopting clean technologies.\n   - Offer low-interest loans for investments in pollution control equipment.\n   - Pollution pricing: Implement a carbon tax to encourage industries to reduce emissions.\n   - Introduce tradable emissions permits, creating a market-driven approach to pollution control.\n\n2. Technological Solutions:\n   - Adoption of cleaner technologies: Upgrade machinery to reduce emissions and improve energy efficiency.\n   - Renewable energy integration: Encourage the use of renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power to reduce dependence on fossil fuels.\n\n3. Policy-Driven Solutions:\n   - Regulatory framework: Establish strict emission standards and enforce regular inspections to ensure compliance.\n   - Public awareness and collaboration: Educate citizens and industries on sustainable practices and involve stakeholders in decision-making processes.",
